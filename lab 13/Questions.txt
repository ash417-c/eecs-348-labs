Question 1:
The Falt is on line 8 (line 3 relative). 
The Loop starts at 1, skipping index 0 when it should be going over every value/index in attendance_Records

Question 2:
vector<int> noFault{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0};
This vector doesn't trigger the fault. No 0 in first position and less than 3 total 0s.

Question 3:
vector<int> fault{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0};
This doesn't trigger the fault. No 0 in first position, true output since 3 0s in total.

Question 4:
vector<int> error{0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0};
This triggers the fault. Only one 0 is counted so absent_Count == 1.
Since it's still less than 3 0s total, function output matches expected.

Question 5:
vector<int> fail{0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0};
This only counts 2 0s when it should count 3, so absent_Count == 2.
Function incorrectly returns false, when it should return true. First 0 is not counted
